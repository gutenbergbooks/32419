<h3>REMARKS.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>George Farquhar, the author of this comedy, was
the son of a clergyman in the north of Ireland. He
was born in the year 1678, discovered an early taste
for literature, and wrote poetic stanzas at ten years
of age.</p>

<p>In 1694 he was sent to Trinity College, Dublin, and
there made such progress in his studies as to acquire
considerable reputation. But he was volatile and
poor&mdash;the first misfortune led him to expense; the
second, to devise means how to support his extravagance.</p>

<p>The theatre has peculiar charms for men of letters.
Whether as a subject of admiration or animadversion,
it is still a source of high amusement; and
here Farquhar fixed his choice of a profession, in the
united expectations of pleasure and of profit&mdash;he appeared
on the stage as an actor, and was disappointed
of both.</p>

<p>The author of this licentious comedy is said to have
possessed the advantages of person, manners, and
elocution, to qualify him for an actor; but that he
could never overcome his natural timidity. Courage
is a whimsical virtue. It acts upon one man so as to
make him expose his whole body to danger, whilst
he dares not venture into the slightest peril one sentiment
of his mind. Such is often the soldier's valour.&mdash;Another
trembles to expose his person either to a
wound or to the eye of criticism, and yet will dare to
publish every thought that ever found entrance into
his imagination. Such is often the valour of a poet.</p>

<p>Farquhar, abashed on exhibiting his person upon
the stage, sent boldly thither his most indecorous
thoughts, and was rewarded for his audacity.</p>

<p>In the year 1700 he brought out this comedy of
"The Constant Couple; or, A Trip to the Jubilee."
It was then the Jubilee year at Rome, and the author
took advantage of that occurrence to render the title
of his drama popular; for which cause alone it must
be supposed he made any thing in his play refer to
that festival, as no one material point is in any shape
connected with it.</p>

<p>At the time Farquhar was a performer, a sincere
friendship was formed between him and Wilks,
the celebrated fine gentleman of the stage&mdash;for him,
Farquhar wrote the character of Sir Harry Wildair;
and Wilks, by the very admirable manner in which
he supported the part, divided with the author those
honours which the first appearance of the work obtained
him.</p>

<p>As a proof that this famed actor's abilities, in the
representation of the fine gentlemen of his day, were
not over-rated, no actor, since he quitted the stage,
has been wholly successful in the performance of
this character; and, from Wilks down to the
present time, the part has only been supported, with celebrity,
by women.</p>

<p>The noted Mrs. Woffington was highly extolled in
Sir Harry; and Mrs. Jordan has been no less admired
and attractive.</p>

<p>But it must be considered as a disgrace to the memory
of the men of fashion, of the period in which
Wildair was brought on the stage, that he has ever
since been justly personated, by no other than the female
sex. In this particular, at least, the present race
of fashionable beaux cannot be said to have degenerated;
for, happily, they can be represented by men.</p>

<p>The love story of Standard and Lurewell, in this
play, is interesting to the reader, though, in action,
an audience scarcely think of either of them; or of
any one in the drama, with whom the hero is not positively
concerned. Yet these two lovers, it would
seem, love with all the usual ardour and constancy of
gallants and mistresses in plays and novels&mdash;unfortunately,
with the same short memories too! Authors,
and some who do not generally deal in wonders, often
make persons, the most tenderly attached to each
other, so easily forget the shape, the air, the every
feature of the dear beloved, as to pass, after a few
years separation, whole days together, without the
least conjecture that each is the very object of the
other's search! Whilst all this surprising forgetfulness
possesses them, as to the figure, face, and mind of him
or her whom they still adore, show either of them
but a ring, a bracelet, a mole, a scar, and here remembrance
instantly occupies its place, and both are
immediately inspired with every sensation which first
testified their mutual passion. Still the sober critic
must arraign the strength of this love with the shortness
of its recollection; and charge the renewal of
affection for objects that no longer appear the same,
to fickleness rather than to constancy.</p>

<p>The biographers of Farquhar, who differ in some
articles concerning him, all agree that he was married,
in the year 1704, to a lady, who was so violently
in love with him, that, despairing to win him
by her own attractions, she contrived a vast scheme
of imposition, by which she allured him into wedlock,
with the full conviction that he had married a
woman of immense fortune.</p>

<p>The same biographers all bestow the highest praise
upon poor Farquhar for having treated this wife
with kindness; humanely forgiving the fault which
had deprived him of that liberty he was known peculiarly
to prize, and reduced him to the utmost poverty,
in order to support her and her children.</p>

<p>This woman, whose pretended love was of such
fatal import to its object, not long enjoyed her selfish
happiness&mdash;her husband's health gradually declined,
and he died four years after his marriage. It is related
that he met death with fortitude and cheerfulness.
He could scarcely do otherwise, when life had
become a burden to him. He had, however, some
objects of affection to leave behind, as appears by the
following letter, which he wrote a few days before
his decease, and directed to his friend Wilks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ind1">"</span><span class="smallcaps">Dear Bob</span>,</p>

<p>"I have not any thing to leave you to perpetuate
my memory, except two helpless girls; look upon
them sometimes, and think of him that was, to the
last moment of his life, thine,</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smallcaps">George Farquhar.</span>"<span class="ind1">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Wilks protected the children&mdash;their mother died in
extreme indigence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Vizard.</i> Angelica send it back unopened! say you?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> As you see, sir?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> The pride of these virtuous women is more
insufferable than the immodesty of prostitutes&mdash;After
all my encouragement, to slight me thus!</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> She said, sir, that imagining your morals
sincere, she gave you access to her conversation; but
that your late behaviour in her company has convinced
her that your love and religion are both hypocrisy,
and that she believes your letter, like yourself,
fair on the outside, and foul within; so sent it
back unopened.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> May obstinacy guard her beauty till
wrinkles bury it.&mdash;I'll be revenged the very first opportunity.&mdash;&mdash;Saw
you the old Lady Darling, her
mother?</p>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Yes, sir, and she was pleased to say much in
your commendation.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> That's my cue&mdash;&mdash;An esteem grafted in
old age is hardly rooted out; years stiffen their opinions
with their bodies, and old zeal is only to be cozened
by young hypocrisy. [<i>Aside.</i>] Run to the
Lady Lurewell's, and know of her maid whether her
ladyship will be at home this evening. Her beauty is
sufficient cure for Angelica's scorn.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Ay, there's a pattern for the young men o'
th' times; at his meditation so early; some book of
pious ejaculations, I'm sure.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> This Hobbes is an excellent fellow! [<i>Aside.</i>]
Oh, uncle Smuggler! To find you at this end o' th'
town is a miracle.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> I have seen a miracle this morning indeed,
cousin Vizard.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> What is it, pray, sir?</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> A man at his devotion so near the court&mdash;I'm
very glad, boy, that you keep your sanctity untainted
in this infectious place; the very air of this
park is heathenish, and every man's breath I meet
scents of atheism.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Surely, sir, some great concern must bring
you to this unsanctified end of the town.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> A very unsanctified concern, truly, cousin.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> What is it?</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> A lawsuit, boy&mdash;Shall I tell you?&mdash;My
ship, the Swan, is newly arrived from St. Sebastian,
laden with Portugal wines: now the impudent rogue
of a tide-waiter has the face to affirm it is French
wines in Spanish casks, and has indicted me upon the
statute&mdash;&mdash;Oh, conscience! conscience! these tide-waiters
and surveyors plague us more than the war&mdash;Ay,
there's another plague of the nation&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Colonel Standard</span>.
 </p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">A red coat and cockade.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Colonel Standard, I'm your humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> May be not, sir.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Why so?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Because&mdash;&mdash;I'm disbanded.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> How! Broke?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> This very morning, in Hyde-Park, my
brave regiment, a thousand men, that looked like
lions yesterday, were scattered, and looked as poor and
simple as the herd of deer that grazed beside them.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Tal, al deral. [<i>Singing.</i>] I'll have a bonfire
this night as high as the monument.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> A bonfire! Thou dry, withered, ill-nature;
had not those brave fellows' swords defended
you, your house had been a bonfire ere this, about
your ears.&mdash;&mdash;Did we not venture our lives, sir?</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> And did we not pay for your lives, sir?&mdash;Venture
your lives! I'm sure we ventured our money,
and that's life and soul to me.&mdash;&mdash;Sir, we'll maintain
you no longer.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Then your wives shall, old Act&aelig;on.
There are five and thirty strapping officers gone this
morning to live upon free quarter in the city.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Oh, lord! oh, lord! I shall have a son
within these nine months, born with a leading staff in
his hand.&mdash;&mdash;Sir, you are&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> What, sir?</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Sir, I say that you are&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> What, sir?</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Disbanded, sir, that's all&mdash;&mdash;I see my lawyer
yonder.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Sir, I'm very sorry for your misfortune.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Why so? I don't come to borrow money
of you; if you're my friend, meet me this evening at
the Rummer; I'll pay my foy, drink a health to my
king, prosperity to my country, and away for Hungary
to-morrow morning.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> What! you won't leave us?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> What! a soldier stay here, to look like
an old pair of colours in Westminster Hall, ragged
and rusty! No, no&mdash;&mdash;I met yesterday a broken lieutenant,
he was ashamed to own that he wanted a dinner,
but wanted to borrow eighteen pence of me to
buy a new scabbard for his sword.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Oh, but you have good friends, colonel!</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Oh, very good friends! My father's a
lord, and my elder brother, a beau; mighty good
indeed!</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> But your country may, perhaps, want your
sword again.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Nay, for that matter, let but a single
drum beat up for volunteers between Ludgate and
Charing Cross, and I shall undoubtedly hear it at the
walls of Buda.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Come, come, colonel, there are ways of
making your fortune at home&mdash;Make your addresses
to the fair; you're a man of honour and courage.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Ay, my courage is like to do me wondrous
service with the fair. This pretty cross cut over
my eye will attract a duchess&mdash;I warrant 'twill be a
mighty grace to my ogling&mdash;Had I used the stratagem
of a certain brother colonel of mine, I might succeed.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> What was it, pray?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Why, to save his pretty face for the women,
he always turned his back upon the enemy.&mdash;He
was a man of honour for the ladies.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Come, come, the loves of Mars and Venus
will never fail; you must get a mistress.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Pr'ythee, no more on't&mdash;You have awakened
a thought, from which, and the kingdom, I would
have stolen away at once.&mdash;&mdash;To be plain, I have a
mistress.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> And she's cruel?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> No.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Her parents prevent your happiness?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Not that.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Then she has no fortune?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> A large one. Beauty to tempt all mankind,
and virtue to beat off their assaults. Oh, Vizard!
such a creature!</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> The joy of the playhouse, and life of the

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Sir Harry Wildair! Did not he go a
volunteer some three or four years ago?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> The same.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Why, he behaved himself very bravely.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Why not? Dost think bravery and gaiety
are inconsistent? He's a gentleman of most happy
circumstances, born to a plentiful estate; has had a
genteel and easy education, free from the rigidness of
teachers, and pedantry of schools. His florid constitution
being never ruffled by misfortune, nor stinted
in its pleasures, has rendered him entertaining to
others, and easy to himself. Turning all passion into
gaiety of humour, by which he chuses rather to rejoice
with his friends, than be hated by any; as you
shall see.</p>

to a pulpit-cushion long ago.&mdash;Sir, if I mistake not
your face, your name is Standard?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Sir Harry, I'm your humble servant.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Come, gentlemen, the news, the news o' th'
town, for I'm just arrived.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Why, in the city end o' th' town we're playing
the knave, to get estates.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> And in the court end playing the fool, in
spending them.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Just so in Paris. I'm glad we're grown so
modish.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> We are so reformed, that gallantry is taken
for vice.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> And hypocrisy for religion.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> A-la-mode de Paris again.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Nothing like an oath in the city.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> That's a mistake; for my major swore a
hundred and fifty last night to a merchant's wife in her
bed-chamber.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pshaw! this is trifling; tell me news, gentlemen.
What lord has lately broke his fortune at
the clubs, or his heart at Newmarket, for the loss of a
race? What wife has been lately suing in Doctor's-Commons
for alimony: or what daughter run away
with her father's valet? What beau gave the noblest
ball at Bath, or had the gayest equipage in town? I
want news, gentlemen.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> 'Faith, sir, these are no news at all.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> But, pray, Sir Harry, tell us some news of
your travels.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> With all my heart.&mdash;You must know, then,
I went over to Amsterdam in a Dutch ship. I went
from thence to Landen, where I was heartily drubbed
in battle, with the butt end of a Swiss musket. I
thence went to Paris, where I had half a dozen intrigues,
bought half a dozen new suits, fought a
couple of duels, and here I am again <i>in statu quo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> But we heard that you designed to make
the tour of Italy: what brought you back so soon?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> That which brought you into the world,
and may perhaps carry you out of it;&mdash;a woman.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> What! quit the pleasures of travel for a
woman?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ay, colonel, for such a woman! I had rather
see her <i>ruelle</i> than the palace of Louis le Grand.
There's more glory in her smile, than in the jubilee at
Rome! and I would rather kiss her hand than the
Pope's toe.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> You, colonel, have been very lavish in the
beauty and virtue of your mistress; and Sir Harry
here has been no less eloquent in the praise of his.
Now will I lay you both ten guineas a-piece, that
neither of them is so pretty, so witty, or so virtuous,
as mine.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> 'Tis done.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I'll double the stakes&mdash;But, gentlemen, now
I think on't, how shall we be resolved? For I know
not where my mistress may be found; she left Paris
about a month before me, and I had an account&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> How, sir! left Paris about a month before
you?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Yes, sir, and I had an account that she lodged
somewhere in St. James's.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> How! somewhere in St. James's say you?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ay, sir, but I know not where, and perhaps
may'nt find her this fortnight.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Her name, pray, Sir Harry?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Ay, ay, her name; perhaps we know her.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Her name! Ay, she has the softest, whitest
hand that ever was made of flesh and blood; her lips
so balmy sweet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> But her name, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then her neck and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> But her name, sir? her quality?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then her shape, colonel?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> But her name I want, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then her eyes, Vizard!</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Pshaw, Sir Harry! her name, or nothing!</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then if you must have it, she's called the
Lady&mdash;&mdash;But then her foot, gentlemen! she dances
to a miracle. Vizard, you have certainly lost your
wager.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Why, you have certainly lost your senses;
we shall never discover the picture, unless you subscribe
the name.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then her name is Lurewell.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> 'Sdeath! my mistress!&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> My mistress, by Jupiter!&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Do you know her, gentlemen?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I have seen her, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Canst tell where she lodges? Tell me, dear
colonel.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Your humble servant, sir.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, hold, colonel; I'll follow you, and
will know.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Runs out.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> The Lady Lurewell his mistress! He loves
her: but she loves me.&mdash;&mdash;But he's a baronet, and I
plain Vizard; he has a coach, and I walk on foot; I
was bred in London, and he in Paris.&mdash;&mdash;That very
circumstance has murdered me&mdash;&mdash;Then some stratagem
must be laid to divert his pretensions.</p>

 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pr'ythee, Dick, what makes the colonel so
out of humour?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Because he's out of pay, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> 'Slife, that's true! I was beginning to mistrust
some rivalship in the case.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> And suppose there were, you know the colonel
can fight, Sir Harry.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Fight! Pshaw&mdash;but he cannot dance, ha!&mdash;We
contend for a woman, Vizard. 'Slife, man, if
ladies were to be gained by sword and pistol only,
what the devil should all we beaux do?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> I'll try him farther. [<i>Aside.</i>] But would
not you, Sir Harry, fight for this woman you so much
admire?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Fight! Let me consider. I love her&mdash;&mdash;that's
true;&mdash;&mdash;but then I love honest Sir Harry
Wildair better. The Lady Lurewell is divinely
charming&mdash;&mdash;right&mdash;&mdash;but then a thrust i' the guts,
or a Middlesex jury, is as ugly as the devil.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Ay, Sir Harry, 'twere a dangerous cast for
a beau baronet to be tried by a parcel of greasy, grumbling,
bartering boobies, who would hang you, purely
because you're a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ay, but on t'other hand, I have money
enough to bribe the rogues with: so, upon mature
deliberation, I would fight for her. But no more of
her. Pr'ythee, Vizard, cannot you recommend a
friend to a pretty mistress by the bye, till I can find
my own? You have store, I'm sure; you cunning
poaching dogs make surer game, than we that hunt
open and fair. Pr'ythee now, good Vizard.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Let me consider a little.&mdash;Now love and
revenge inspire my politics!&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p class="right">[<i>Pauses whilst</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir Harry</span> <i>walks, singing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pshaw! thou'rt longer studying for a new
mistress, than a waiter would be in drawing fifty
corks.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> I design you good wine; you'll therefore
bear a little expectation.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ha! say'st thou, dear Vizard?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> A girl of nineteen, Sir Harry.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Now nineteen thousand blessings light on
thee.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Pretty and witty.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ay, ay, but her name, Vizard!</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Her name! yes&mdash;she has the softest, whitest
hand that e'er was made of flesh and blood; her
lips so balmy sweet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Well, well, but where shall I find her, man?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Find her!&mdash;but then her foot, Sir Harry!
she dances to a miracle.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pr'ythee, don't distract me.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Well then, you must know, that this lady is
the greatest beauty in town; her name's Angelica:
she that passes for her mother is a private bawd, and
called the Lady Darling: she goes for a baronet's
lady, (no disparagement to your honour, Sir Harry)
I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pshaw, hang my honour! but what street,
what house?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Not so fast, Sir Harry; you must have my
passport for your admittance, and you'll find my recommendation
in a line or two will procure you very
civil entertainment; I suppose twenty or thirty pieces
handsomely placed, will gain the point.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Thou dearest friend to a man in necessity!
Here, sirrah, order my carriage about to St. James's;
I'll walk across the park. [<i>To his</i> <span class="smallcaps">Servant</span>.</p>

your most devoted&mdash;Sir, [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Wildair</span>.] I admire
the mode of your shoulder-knot; methinks it hangs
very emphatically, and carries an air of travel in it:
your sword-knot too is most ornamentally modish, and
bears a foreign mien. Gentlemen, my brother is just
arrived in town; so that, being upon the wing to kiss
his hands, I hope you'll pardon this abrupt departure

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pr'ythee, dost know him?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Know him! why, it is Clincher, who was
apprentice to my uncle Smuggler, the merchant in the
city.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> What makes him so gay?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Why, he's in mourning.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> In mourning?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Yes, for his father. The kind old man in
Hertfordshire t'other day broke his neck a fox-hunting;
the son, upon the news, has broke his indentures;
whipped from behind the counter into the side-box.
He keeps his coach and liveries, brace of geldings,
leash of mistresses, talks of nothing but wines, intrigues,
plays, fashions, and going to the jubilee.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ha! ha! ha! how many pounds of pulvil
must the fellow use in sweetening himself from the
smell of hops and tobacco? Faugh!&mdash;I' my conscience
methought, like Olivia's lover, he stunk of Thames-Street.
But now for Angelica, that's her name: we'll

<br />
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Lurewell</span>, <i>and her Maid</i> <span class="smallcaps">Parly</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Lady L.</i> Parly, my pocket-book&mdash;let me see&mdash;Madrid,
Paris, Venice, London!&mdash;Ay, London! They
may talk what they will of the hot countries, but I
find love most fruitful under this climate&mdash;&mdash;In a
month's space have I gained&mdash;let me see, imprimis,
Colonel Standard.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> And how will your ladyship manage him?</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> As all soldiers should be managed; he
shall serve me till I gain my ends, then I'll disband
him.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> But he loves you, madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Therefore I scorn him;<br />
I hate all that don't love me, and slight all that do;<br />
'Would his whole deluding sex admir'd me,<br />
Thus would I slight them all.<br />
My virgin and unwary innocence<br />
Was wrong'd by faithless man;<br />
But now, glance eyes, plot brain, dissemble face,<br />
Lie tongue, and<br />
Plague the treacherous kind.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
Let me survey my captives.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
The colonel leads the van; next, Mr. Vizard,<br />
He courts me out of the "Practice of Piety,"<br />
Therefore is a hypocrite;<br />
Then Clincher, he adores me with orangerie,<br />
And is consequently a fool;<br />
Then my old merchant, Alderman Smuggler,<br />
He's a compound of both;&mdash;out of which medley of
lovers, if I don't make good diversion&mdash;&mdash;What d'ye
think, Parly?</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> I think, madam, I'm like to be very virtuous
in your service, if you teach me all those tricks that
you use to your lovers.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> You're a fool, child; observe this, that
though a woman swear, forswear, lie, dissemble, backbite,
be proud, vain, malicious, any thing, if she secures
the main chance, she's still virtuous; that's a
maxim.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> I can't be persuaded, though, madam, but
that you really loved Sir Harry Wildair in Paris.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Of all the lovers I ever had, he was my
greatest plague, for I could never make him uneasy:
I left him involved in a duel upon my account: I
long to know whether the fop be killed or not.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent">
  <i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Colonel Standard</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Oh lord! no sooner talk of killing, but the soldier is
conjured up. You're upon hard duty, colonel, to
serve your king, your country, and a mistress too.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> The latter, I must confess, is the hardest;
for in war, madam, we can be relieved in our duty;
but in love, he, who would take our post, is our enemy;
emulation in glory is transporting, but rivals here
intolerable.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Those that bear away the prize in arms,
should boast the same success in love; and, I think,
considering the weakness of our sex, we should make
those our companions who can be our champions.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I once, madam, hoped the honour of
defending you from all injuries, through a title to
your lovely person; but now my love must attend my
fortune. My commission, madam, was my passport
to the fair; adding a nobleness to my passion, it
stamped a value on my love; 'twas once the life of
honour, but now its winding sheet; and with it must
my love be buried.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> What? disbanded, Colonel?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Yes, Mrs. Parly.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> Faugh, the nauseous fellow! he stinks of
poverty already.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> His misfortune troubles me, because it
may prevent my designs.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I'll chuse, madam, rather to destroy
my passion by absence abroad, than have it starved
at home.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> I'm sorry, sir, you have so mean an opinion
of my affection, as to imagine it founded upon
your fortune. And, to convince you of your mistake,
here I vow, by all that's sacred, I own the same
affection now as before. Let it suffice, my fortune is
considerable.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> No, madam, no; I'll never be a charge
to her I love! The man, that sells himself for gold,
is the worst of prostitutes.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Now, were he any other creature but a
man, I could love him.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> This only last request I make, that no
title recommend a fool, no office introduce a knave,
nor red coat a coward, to my place in your affections;
so farewell my country, and adieu my love.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Now the devil take thee for being so honourable:
here, Parly, call him back, I shall lose
half my diversion else. Now for a trial of skill.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Colonel Standard</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Sir, I hope you'll pardon my curiosity. When do
you take your journey?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> To-morrow morning, early, madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> So suddenly! which way are you designed
to travel?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> That I can't yet resolve on.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Pray, sir, tell me; pray, sir; I entreat
you; why are you so obstinate?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Why are you so curious, madam?</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Because&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Because, I, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Because, what, madam?&mdash;Pray tell me.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Because I design to follow you.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Crying.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Follow me! By all that's great, I ne'er
was proud before. Follow me! By Heavens thou
shalt not. What! expose thee to the hazards of a
camp!&mdash;Rather I'll stay, and here bear the contempt
of fools, and worst of fortune.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> You need not, shall not; my estate for
both is sufficient.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Thy estate! No, I'll turn a knave, and
purchase one myself; I'll cringe to the proud man
I undermine; I'll tip my tongue with flattery, and
smooth my face with smiles; I'll turn informer, office-broker,
nay, coward, to be great; and sacrifice
it all to thee, my generous fair.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> And I'll dissemble, lie, swear, jilt, any
thing, but I'll reward thy love, and recompense thy
noble passion.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Sir Harry, ha! ha! ha! poor Sir Harry,
ha! ha! ha! Rather kiss her hand than the Pope's
toe; ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> What Sir Harry, Colonel? What Sir
Harry?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Sir Harry Wildair, madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> What! is he come over?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Ay, and he told me&mdash;but I don't believe
a syllable on't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> What did he tell you?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Only called you his mistress; and pretending
to be extravagant in your commendation,
would vainly insinuate the praise of his own judgment
and good fortune in a choice.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> How easily is the vanity of fops tickled
by our sex!</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Why, your sex is the vanity of fops.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> On my conscience, I believe so. This
gentleman, because he danced well, I pitched on for
a partner at a ball in Paris, and ever since he has so
persecuted me with letters, songs, dances, serenading,
flattery, foppery, and noise, that I was forced to fly
the kingdom.&mdash;&mdash;And I warrant you he made you
jealous?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> 'Faith, madam, I was a little uneasy.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> You shall have a plentiful revenge; I'll
send him back all his foolish letters, songs, and verses,
and you yourself shall carry them: 'twill afford you
opportunity of triumphing, and free me from his further
impertinence; for of all men he's my aversion.
I'll run and fetch them instantly.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Dear madam, a rare project! Now shall
I bait him, like Act&aelig;on, with his own dogs.&mdash;&mdash;Well,
Mrs. Parly, it is ordered by act of parliament, that
you receive no more pieces, Mrs. Parly.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> 'Tis provided by the same act, that you
send no more messages by me, good Colonel; you
must not presume to send any more letters, unless
you can pay the postage.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Come, come, don't be mercenary; take
example by your lady, be honourable.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> A-lack-a-day, sir, it shows as ridiculous and
haughty for us to imitate our betters in their honour,
as in their finery; leave honour to nobility that can
support it: we poor folks, Colonel, have no pretence
to't; and truly, I think, sir, that your honour should
be cashiered with your leading-staff.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> 'Tis one of the greatest curses of poverty
to be the jest of chambermaids!</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Sir Harry! Sir Harry!</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I am in haste, Colonel; besides, if you're
in no better humour than when I parted with you in
the park this morning, your company won't be very
agreeable.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> You're a happy man, Sir Harry, who
are never out of humour. Can nothing move your
gall, Sir Harry?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nothing but impossibilities, which are the
same as nothing.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> What impossibilities?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> The resurrection of my father to disinherit
me, or an act of parliament against wenching. A
man of eight thousand pounds <i>per annum</i> to be vexed!
No, no; anger and spleen are companions for younger
brothers.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Suppose one called you a son of a
whore behind your back.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why, then would I call him rascal behind
his back; so we're even.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> But suppose you had lost a mistress.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why, then I would get another.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> But suppose you were discarded by
the woman you love; that would surely trouble you.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> You're mistaken, Colonel; my love is neither
romantically honourable, nor meanly mercenary;
'tis only a pitch of gratitude: while she loves
me, I love her; when she desists, the obligation's
void.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> But to be mistaken in your opinion,
sir; if the Lady Lurewell (only suppose it) had discarded
you&mdash;I say, only suppose it&mdash;&mdash;and had sent
your discharge by me.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pshaw! that's another impossibility.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Are you sure of that?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why, 'twere a solecism in nature. Why,
we are finger and glove, sir. She dances with me,
sings with me, plays with me, swears with me, lies
with me.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> How, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I mean in an honourable way; that is, she
lies for me. In short, we are as like one another as a
couple of guineas.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Now that I have raised you to the highest
pinnacle of vanity, will I give you so mortifying a
fall, as shall dash your hopes to pieces.&mdash;I pray
your honour to peruse these papers.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Gives him the Packet.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> What is't, the muster-roll of your regiment,

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> No, no, 'tis a list of your forces in your
last love campaign; and, for your comfort, all disbanded.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Pr'ythee, good metaphorical colonel, what
d'ye mean?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Read, sir, read; these are the Sibyl's

sir. Read, read.</p>

beauty contending&mdash;&mdash;force of charms&mdash;&mdash;mankind&mdash;&mdash;eternal

in her smile than in the Jubilee at Rome; ha! ha!
ha! But then her foot, Sir Harry; she dances to a
miracle! ha! ha! ha! Fie, Sir Harry; a man of
your parts write letters not worth keeping!</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Now, why should I be angry that a woman
is a woman? Since inconstancy and falsehood are
grounded in their natures, how can they help it?&mdash;Here's
a copy of verses too: I must turn poet, in the
devil's name&mdash;Stay&mdash;'Sdeath, what's here?&mdash;This is

you know that I lodge in Pall Mall</i>&mdash;<span class="smallcaps">Lurewell</span>.<br />

<ins title="original has vered">delivered</ins> half my message.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Upon my faith, but you have, colonel.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Well, well, own your spleen; out with
it; I know you're like to burst.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I am so, 'egad; ha! ha! ha!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Laugh and point at one another.</i></p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Ay, with all my heart; ha! ha! Well,
well, that's forced, Sir Harry.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I was never better pleased in all my life,
by Jupiter.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Well, Sir Harry, 'tis prudence to hide
your concern, when there's no help for it. But, to
be serious, now; the lady has sent you back all your
papers there&mdash;&mdash;I was so just as not to look upon
them.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I'm glad on't, sir; for there were some
things that I would not have you see.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> All this she has done for my sake; and I

your own sake. So, honest, goodnatured Sir Harry,
I'm your humble servant.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> 'Faith, madam, trading is very dead; what
with paying the taxes, losses at sea abroad, and maintaining
our wives at home, the bank is reduced very
low; money is very scarce.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Come, come, sir; these evasions won't

don't design to cheat me?</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Cheat you, madam! have a care what you

I have been an honest citizen these five-and-thirty
years.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> An honest citizen! Bear witness, Parly&mdash;I
shall trap him in more lies presently. Come, sir,
though I am a woman, I can take a remedy.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> What remedy, madam? You'll go to law,
will ye? I can maintain a suit of law, be it right or
wrong, these forty years&mdash;thanks to the honest practice
of the courts.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Sir, I'll blast your reputation, and so ruin
your credit.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Blast my reputation! he! he! he! Why,
I'm a religious man, madam; I have been very instrumental
in the reformation of manners. Ruin my
credit! Ah, poor woman! There is but one way, madam&mdash;&mdash;you
have a sweet leering eye.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> You instrumental in the reformation?&mdash;How?</p>

Sir Harry, you promised me, in Paris, never to ask

are never kept.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Would you marry me, Sir Harry?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Oh! I do detest marriage.&mdash;But I will

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Out with it, madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Why, the merchant, sir, that transmitted
your bills of exchange to you in France, complains of
some indirect and dishonourable dealings.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Ay, ay, you know him, I find.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I have some reason, I think; why, the
rogue has cheated me of above five hundred pounds
within these three years.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> 'Tis your business then to acquit yourself
publicly; for he spreads the scandal every where.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Acquit myself publicly! I'll drive instantly
into the city, and cane the old villain: he shall run
the gauntlet round the Royal Exchange.</p>

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I bring him word where she lodged? I
the civilest rival in the world? 'Tis impossible.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> I shall urge it no farther, sir. I only thought,
sir, that my character in the world might add authority
to my words, without so many repetitions.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Pardon me, dear Vizard. Our belief
struggles hard, before it can be brought to yield to
the disadvantage of what we love. But what said
Sir Harry?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> He pitied the poor credulous colonel,
laughed heartily, flew away with all the raptures of
a bridegroom, repeating these lines:</p>

<div class="center">
 <table style="margin: 0 auto" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="text">

<tr><td align="left">Whose wit can whet, whene'er her beauty cloys.</td></tr>

</div>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> A mistress ne'er can pall! By all my
wrongs he whores her, and I am made their property.&mdash;&mdash;Vengeance&mdash;&mdash;Vizard,
you must carry a note
for me to Sir Harry.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> What, a challenge? I hope you don't design
to fight?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> What, wear the livery of my king, and
pocket an affront? 'Twere an abuse to his sacred Majesty:
a soldier's sword, Vizard, should start of itself,
to redress its master's wrong.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> However, sir, I think it not proper for me
to carry any such message between friends.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I have ne'er a servant here; what shall
I do?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> There's Tom Errand, the porter, that plies
at the Blue Posts, one who knows Sir Harry and his
haunts very well; you may send a note by him.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Here, you, friend.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> I have now some business, and must take
my leave; I would advise you, nevertheless, against
this affair.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> No whispering now, nor telling of friends,
to prevent us. He, that disappoints a man of an honourable
revenge, may love him foolishly like a wife,
but never value him as a friend.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Nay, the devil take him, that parts you,
say I.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Did your honour call porter?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Is your name Tom Errand?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> People call me so, an't like your worship.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> D'ye know Sir Harry Wildair?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Ay, very well, sir; he's one of my best masters;
many a round half crown have I had of his worship;
he's newly come home from France, sir.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Go to the next coffee-house, and wait
for me.&mdash;&mdash;Oh, woman, woman, how blessed is man,
when favoured by your smiles, and how accursed
when all those smiles are found but wanton baits to
sooth us to destruction.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

</div>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Sir, sir, sir, having some business of importance
to communicate to you, I would beg your
attention to a trifling affair, that I would impart to
your understanding.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> What is your trifling business of importance,
pray, sweet sir?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Pray, sir, are the roads deep between
this and Paris?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why that question, sir?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Because I design to go to the jubilee,
sir. I understand that you are a traveller, sir; there
is an air of travel in the tie of your cravat, sir: there
is indeed, sir&mdash;&mdash;I suppose, sir, you bought this lace
in Flanders.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> No, sir, this lace was made in Norway.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Norway, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Yes, sir, of the shavings of deal boards.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> That's very strange now, 'faith&mdash;Lace
made of the shavings of deal boards! 'Egad, sir, you
travellers see very strange things abroad, very incredible
things abroad, indeed. Well, I'll have a cravat
of the very same lace before I come home.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> But, sir, what preparations have you made
for your journey?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> A case of pocket-pistols for the bravos,
and a swimming-girdle.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why these, sir?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Oh, lord, sir, I'll tell you&mdash;&mdash;Suppose
us in Rome now; away goes I to some ball&mdash;for I'll
be a mighty beau. Then, as I said, I go to some
ball, or some bear-baiting&mdash;'tis all one, you know&mdash;then
comes a fine Italian <i>bona roba</i>, and plucks me by
the sleeve: Signior Angle, Signior Angle&mdash;She's a
very fine lady, observe that&mdash;Signior Angle, says she&mdash;Signiora,
says I, and trips after her to the corner
of a street, suppose it Russel Street, here, or any other
street: then, you know, I must invite her to the tavern;
I can do no less&mdash;&mdash;There up comes her bravo;
the Italian grows saucy, and I give him an English
dowse on the face: I can box, sir, box tightly;
I was a 'prentice, sir&mdash;&mdash;But then, sir, he whips out
his stiletto, and I whips out my bull-dog&mdash;slaps him
through, trips down stairs, turns the corner of Russel
Street again, and whips me into the ambassador's
train, and there I'm safe as a beau behind the scenes.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Is your pistol charged, sir?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Only a brace of bullets, that's all, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> 'Tis a very fine pistol, truly; pray let me
see it.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> With all my heart, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Harkye, Mr. Jubilee, can you digest a brace
of bullets?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Oh, by no means in the world, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I'll try the strength of your stomach, however.
Sir, you're a dead man.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Presenting the Pistol to his Breast.</i></p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Consider, dear sir, I am going to the
Jubilee: when I come home again, I am a dead man
at your service.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Oh, very well, sir; but take heed you are
not so choleric for the future.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Choleric, sir! Oons, I design to shoot
seven Italians in a week, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Sir, you won't have provocation.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Provocation, sir! Zouns, sir, I'll kill
any man for treading upon my corns: and there will
be a devilish throng of people there: they say that all
the princes of Italy will be there.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> And all the fops and fiddlers in Europe&mdash;&mdash;But
the use of your swimming girdle, pray sir?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Oh lord, sir, that's easy. Suppose the
ship cast away; now, whilst, other foolish people are
busy at their prayers, I whip on my swimming girdle,
clap a month's provision in my pocket, and sails me
away, like an egg in a duck's belly. Well, sir, you must
pardon me now, I'm going to see my mistress.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> This fellow's an accomplished ass before he
goes abroad. Well, this Angelica has got into my

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Quality!&mdash;Why, madam, I don't know
what you mean by your madmen, and your beaux,
and your quality&mdash;&mdash;they're all alike, I believe.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> Pray, sir, walk with me into the next

<p><i>Ang.</i> Sir, if your conversation be no more agreeable
than 'twas the last time, I would advise you to
make your visit as short as you can.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> The offences of my last visit, madam, bore
their punishment in the commission; and have made
me as uneasy till I receive pardon, as your ladyship
can be till I sue for it.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Sir Harry, I did not well understand the offence,
and must therefore proportion it to the greatness
of your apology; if you would, therefore, have
me think it light, take no great pains in an excuse.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> How sweet must the lips be that guard that
tongue! Then, madam, no more of past offences; let
us prepare for joys to come. Let this seal my pardon.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Kisses her Hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Hold, sir: one question, Sir Harry, and pray
answer plainly&mdash;D'ye love me?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Love you! Does fire ascend? Do hypocrites
dissemble? Usurers love gold, or great men flattery?
Doubt these, then question that I love.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> This shows your gallantry, sir, but not your
love.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> View your own charms, madam, then judge
my passion.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> If your words be real, 'tis in your power to
raise an equal flame in me.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, then, I seize&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Hold, sir; 'tis also possible to make me detest
and scorn you worse than the most profligate of
your deceiving sex.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ha! a very odd turn this. I hope, madam,
you only affect anger, because you know your frowns
are becoming.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Sir Harry, you being the best judge of your
own designs, can best understand whether my anger
should be real or dissembled; think what strict modesty
should bear, then judge of my resentment.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Strict modesty should bear! Why, 'faith,
madam, I believe, the strictest modesty may bear fifty
guineas, and I don't believe 'twill bear one farthing
more.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> What d'ye mean, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, madam, what do you mean? If you
go to that. I think now, fifty guineas is a fine offer
for your strict modesty, as you call it.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> I'm afraid you're mad, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why, madam, you're enough to make any
man mad. 'Sdeath, are you not a&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> What, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why, a lady of&mdash;strict modesty, if you will
have it so.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> I shall never hereafter trust common report,
which represented you, sir, a man of honour, wit, and
breeding; for I find you very deficient in them all
three.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Now I find, that the strict pretences, which
the ladies of pleasure make to strict modesty, is the
reason why those of quality are ashamed to wear it.</p>

 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Vizard</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Ah! Sir Harry, have I caught you? Well,
and what success?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Success! 'Tis a shame for you young fellows
in town here, to let the wenches grow so saucy.
I offered her fifty guineas, and she was in her airs presently,
and flew away in a huff. I could have had a
brace of countesses in Paris for half the money, and
<i>je vous remercie</i> into the bargain.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Gone in her airs, say you! and did not
you follow her?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Whither should I follow her?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Into her bedchamber, man; she went on
purpose. You a man of gallantry, and not understand
that a lady's best pleased when she puts on her
airs, as you call it!</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> She talked to me of strict modesty, and
stuff.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Certainly. Most women magnify their
modesty, for the same reason that cowards boast their
courage&mdash;because they have least on't. Come, come,
Sir Harry, when you make your next assault, encourage
your spirits with brisk Burgundy: if you succeed,
'tis well; if not, you have a fair excuse for your
rudeness. I'll go in, and make your peace for what's
past. Oh, I had almost forgot&mdash;&mdash;Colonel Standard
wants to speak with you about some business.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I'll wait upon him presently; d'ye know
where he may be found?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> In the piazza of Covent Garden, about an
hour hence, I promised to see him: and there you
may meet him&mdash;to have your throat cut. [<i>Aside.</i>] I'll
go in and intercede for you.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> But no foul play with the lady, Vizard.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> No fair play, I can assure you.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

thought, sir, that I gave you caution enough against
troubling me with Sir Harry Wildair's company, when
I sent his letters back by you; yet you, forsooth,
must tell him where I lodged, and expose me again to
his impertinent courtship!</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I expose you to his courtship!</p>

suspicions: but it is an ungrateful return.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Weeping.</i></span></p>

 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lurewell</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Parly</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Oh, my poor gentleman! and was it
beaten?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Yes, I have been beaten. But where's
my clothes? my clothes?</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> What, you won't leave me so soon, my
dear, will ye?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Will ye!&mdash;If ever I peep into the colonel's
tent again, may I be forced to run the gauntlet.
But my clothes, madam.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> I sent the porter down stairs with them:
did not you meet him?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Meet him? No, not I.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> No! He went out at the back door, and is
run clear away, I'm afraid.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Gone, say you, and with my clothes,
my fine Jubilee clothes?&mdash;Oh, the rogue, the thief!&mdash;I'll
have him hang'd for murder&mdash;But how shall I get
home in this pickle?</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> I'm afraid, sir, the colonel will be back presently,
for he dines at home.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Oh, then I must sneak off.
Was ever such an unfortunate beau,
To have his coat well thrash'd, and lose his coat also!&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> Methinks, madam, the injuries you have
suffered by men must be very great, to raise such
heavy resentments against the whole sex;&mdash;and, I
think, madam, your anger should be only confined to
the author of your wrongs.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> The author! alas, I know him not.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> Not know him? Tis odd, madam, that a
man should rob you of that same jewel, and you not
know him.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Leave trifling: 'tis a subject that always
sours my temper: but since, by thy faithful service, I
have some reason to confide in your secresy, hear the
strange relation.&mdash;Some twelve years ago, I lived at
my father's house in Oxfordshire, blest with innocence,
the ornamental, but weak guard of blooming
beauty. Then it happened that three young gentlemen
from the university coming into the country, and
being benighted, and strangers, called at my father's:
he was very glad of their company, and offered them
the entertainment of his house.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> Which they accepted, no doubt. Oh, these
strolling collegians are never abroad, but upon some
mischief.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Two of them had a heavy, pedantic air:
but the third&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> Ah, the third, madam&mdash;the third of all
things, they say, is very critical.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> He was&mdash;but in short, nature formed him
for my undoing. His very looks were witty, and his
expressive eyes spoke softer, prettier things, than words
could frame.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> There will be mischief by and by; I never
heard a woman talk so much of eyes, but there were
tears presently after.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> My father was so well pleased with his
conversation, that he begged their company next day;
they consented, and next night, Parly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> Ah, next night, madam&mdash;&mdash;next night (I'm
afraid) was a night indeed.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> He bribed my maid, with his gold, out of
her modesty; and me, with his rhetoric, out of my
honour. [<i>Weeps.</i>] He swore that he would come
down from Oxford in a fortnight, and marry me.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> The old bait, the old bait&mdash;I was cheated
just so myself. [<i>Aside.</i>] But had not you the wit to
know his name all this while?</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> He told me that he was under an obligation
to his companions, of concealing himself then, but,
that he would write to me in two days, and let me
know his name and quality. After all the binding
oaths of constancy, I gave him a ring with this motto&mdash;"<i>Love
and Honour</i>"&mdash;then we parted, and I never
saw the dear deceiver more.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> No, nor never will, I warrant you.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> I need not tell my griefs, which my father's
death made a fair pretence for; he left me sole
heiress and executrix to three thousand pounds a
year: at last, my love for this single dissembler turned
to a hatred of the whole sex; and, resolving to divert
my melancholy, I went to travel. Here I will
play my last scene; then retire to my country-house,
and live solitary. We shall have that old impotent
lecher, Smuggler, here to-night; I have a plot to
swinge him, and his precise nephew, Vizard.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> I think, madam, you manage every body
that comes in your way.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> No, Parly; those men, whose pretensions
I found just and honourable, I fairly dismissed, by letting
them know my firm resolutions never to marry,
But those villains, that would attempt my honour, I've
seldom failed to manage.</p>

<p><i>Parly.</i> What d'ye think of the colonel, madam? I
suppose his designs are honourable.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> That man's a riddle; there's something of
honour in his temper that pleases; I'm sure he loves
me too, because he's soon jealous, and soon satisfied.&mdash;But
hang him, I have teased him enough&mdash;Besides,
Parly, I begin to be tired of my revenge: but this
buss and guinea I must maul once more. I'll hansel
his woman's clothes for him. Go, get me pen and ink;
I must write to Vizard too.</p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<br />
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir H. Wildair</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Colonel Standard</span>,
<i>meeting</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I thought, Sir Harry, to have met you
ere this in a more convenient place; but since my
wrongs were without ceremony, my revenge shall be
so too.&mdash;Draw, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Draw, sir! What shall I draw?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Come, come, sir, I like your facetious
humour well enough; it shows courage and unconcern.
I know you brave, and therefore use you thus.
Draw your sword.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, to oblige you, I will draw; but the
devil take me if I fight.&mdash;Perhaps, colonel, this is the
prettiest blade you have seen.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I doubt not but the arm is good; and
therefore think both worth my resentment. Come,
sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> But, pr'ythee, colonel, dost think that I am
such a madman, as to send my soul to the devil and
body to the worms&mdash;upon every fool's errand?&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I hope you're no coward, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Coward, sir! I have eight thousand pounds
a year, sir.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> You fought in the army, to my knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ay, for the same reason that I wore a red
coat; because 'twas fashionable.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Sir, you fought a French count in Paris.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> True, sir, he was a beau, like myself. Now
you're a soldier, colonel, and fighting's your trade;
and I think it downright madness to contend with
any man in his profession.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Come, sir, no more dallying; I shall
take very unseemly methods, if you don't show yourself
a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> A gentleman! Why, there again, now. A
gentleman! I tell you once more, colonel, that I am
a baronet, and have eight thousand pounds a year. I
can dance, sing, ride, fence, understand the languages&mdash;Now
I can't conceive how running you through
the body should contribute one jot more to my gentility.
But pray, colonel, I had forgot to ask you,
what's the quarrel?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> A woman, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then I put up my sword. Take her.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Sir, my honour's concerned.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, if your honour be concerned with a
woman, get it out of her hands as soon as you can.&mdash;An
honourable lover is the greatest slave in nature:
some will say, the greatest fool. Come, come, colonel,
this is something about the Lady Lurewell, I
warrant; I can give you satisfaction in that affair.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Do so then immediately.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Put up your sword first; you know I dare
fight, but I had much rather make you a friend than
an enemy. I can assure you this lady will prove too
hard for one of your temper. You have too much
honour, too much in conscience, to be a favourite
with the ladies.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I'm assured, sir, she never gave you any
encouragement.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> A man can never hear reason with his
sword in his hand. Sheath your weapon; and then,
if I don't satisfy you, sheath it in my body.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Give me but demonstration of her granting
you any favour, and it is enough.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Will you take my word?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Pardon me, sir, I cannot.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Will you believe your own eyes?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> 'Tis ten to one whether I shall or no;
they have deceived me already.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> That's hard&mdash;but some means I shall devise
for your satisfaction&mdash;[<i>Noise.</i>]&mdash;We must fly this
place, else that cluster of mob will overwhelm us.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

my fine Jubilee clothes.</p>

murdered my husband, and robbed him of his clothes.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> Murder and robbery!&mdash;Then he must be a
gentleman.&mdash;&mdash;Hands off there; he must not be
abused.&mdash;&mdash;Give an account of yourself. Are you a
gentleman?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> No, sir, I'm a beau.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> A beau&mdash;Then you have killed nobody, I'm
persuaded. How came you by these clothes, sir?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> You must know, sir, that walking along,
sir, I don't know how, sir, I can't tell where, sir,&mdash;and
so the porter and I changed clothes, sir.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> Very well. The man speaks reason, and like
a gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> But pray, Mr. Constable, ask him how he
changed clothes with him.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> Silence, woman, and don't disturb the court.
Well, sir, how did you change clothes?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Why, sir, he pulled off my coat, and I
drew off his: so I put on his coat, and he put on
mine.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> Why, neighbour, I don't find that he's guilty:
search him&mdash;and if he carries no arms about him,
we'll let him go.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>They search his Pockets, and pull out his Pistols.</i></p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Oh, gemini! My Jubilee pistols!</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> What, a case of pistols! Then the case is
plain. Speak, what are you, sir? Whence came you,
and whither go you?</p>

<p><i>Clinch. sen.</i> Sir, I came from Russel Street, and am
going to the Jubilee.</p>

<p><i>Wife.</i> You shall go the gallows, you rogue.</p>

<p><i>Const.</i> Away with him, away with him to Newgate,

<p><i>Sir H.</i> In short, colonel, 'tis all nonsense&mdash;fight
for a woman! Hard by is the lady's house, if you
please, we'll wait on her together: you shall draw
your sword&mdash;I'll draw my snuff-box: you shall produce
your wounds received in war&mdash;I'll relate mine by
Cupid's dart: you shall swear&mdash;I'll sigh: you shall
sa, sa, and I'll coup&eacute;e; and if she flies not to my arms,
like a hawk to its perch, my dancing-master deserves
to be damned.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> With the generality of women, I grant
you, these arts may prevail.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Generality of women! Why there again,
you're out. They're all alike, sir: I never heard of
any one that was particular, but one.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Who was she, pray?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Penelope, I think she's called, and that's a
poetical story too. When will you find a poet in our
age make a woman so chaste?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Well, Sir Harry, your facetious humour
can disguise falsehood, and make calumny pass for
satire; but you have promised me ocular demonstration
that she favours you: make that good, and I
shall then maintain faith and female to be as inconsistent
as truth and falsehood.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> But will you be convinced, if our plot succeeds.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I rely on your word and honour, Sir
Harry.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then meet me half an hour hence at the
Shakspeare; you must oblige me by taking a hearty
glass with me toward the fitting me out for a certain
project, which this night I undertake.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I guess, by the preparation, that woman's
the design.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Yes, 'faith.&mdash;I am taken dangerously ill with
two foolish maladies, modesty and love: the first I'll
cure with Burgundy, and my love by a night's lodging
with the damsel. A sure remedy. <i>Probatum est.</i></p>

<p><i>Dicky.</i> Ay, sir, he'll spend his whole estate at this

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Who, pray?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> This lace will sell. What a blockhead was
the fellow to trust me with his coat! If I can get
cross the garden, down to the water-side, I am pretty

<p><i>Dicky.</i> I seize you in the kings name, sir.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Oh, lord! should this prove some parliament
man now!</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Speak, you rogue, what are you?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A poor porter, and going of an errand.</p>

<p><i>Dicky.</i> What errand? Speak, you rogue.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A fool's errand, I'm afraid.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Who sent you?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> A beau, sir.</p>

<p><i>Dicky.</i> No, no; the rogue has murdered your
brother, and stripped him of his clothes.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Murdered my brother! Oh, crimini!
Oh, my poor Jubilee brother! Stay, by Jupiter Ammon,
I'm heir though. Speak, sir, have you killed
him? Confess that you have killed him, and I'll give
you half a crown.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Who I, sir? Alack-a-day, sir, I never killed
any man, but a carrier's horse once.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Then you shall certainly be hanged;
but confess that you killed him, and we'll let you go.</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Telling the truth hangs a man, but confessing
a lie can do no harm: besides, if the worst come to
the worst, I can but deny it again.&mdash;Well, sir, since I
must tell you, I did kill him.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Here's your money, sir.&mdash;But are you
sure you killed him dead?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Sir, I'll swear it before any judge in England.</p>

<p><i>Dicky.</i> But are you sure that he's dead in law?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> Dead in law! I can't tell whether he be
dead in law. But he's as dead as a door nail; for I
gave him seven knocks on the head with a hammer.</p>

<p><i>Dicky.</i> Then you have the estate by statute. Any
man that's knocked on the head is dead in law.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> But are you sure he was compos mentis
when he was killed?</p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I suppose he was, sir; for he told me nothing
to the contrary afterwards.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Hey! Then I go to the Jubilee.&mdash;Strip,
sir, strip. By Jupiter Ammon, strip.</p>

<p><i>Dicky.</i> Ah! don't swear, sir.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Puts on his Brother's Clothes.</i></p>

<p><i>Tom.</i> I hope you'll let me go now, sir.</p>

<p><i>Clinch. jun.</i> Yes, yes, sir; but you must do the favour
to swear positively before a magistrate, that you killed
him dead, that I may enter upon the estate without
any trouble. By Jupiter Ammon, all my religion's
gone, since I put on these fine clothes.&mdash;Hey, call me

him. And I'll go see Angelica. [<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smallcaps">Dicky</span>

have an old uncle, Alderman Smuggler; you have seen
him, I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Yes, yes, I have some small acquaintance
with him.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> 'Tis the most knavish, precise, covetous old
rogue, that ever died of the gout.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Ah, the young son of a whore! [<i>Aside.</i>]
Well, sir, and what of him?</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Why, madam, he has a swingeing estate,
which I design to purchase as a saint, and spend like a
gentleman. He got it by cheating, and should lose it
by deceit. By the pretence of my zeal and sobriety, I'll
cozen the old miser, one of these days, out of a settlement
and deed of conveyance&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> It shall be a deed to convey you to the gallows
then, ye young dog.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> And no sooner he's dead, but I'll rattle over
his grave with a coach and six, to inform his covetous
ghost how genteelly I spend his money.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> I'll prevent you, boy; for I'll have my money
buried with me.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Bless me, madam! here's a light coming
this way. I must fly immediately.&mdash;&mdash;When shall I
see you, madam?</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Sooner than you expect, my dear.</p>

<p><i>Vizard.</i> Pardon me, dear madam, I would not be
seen for the world. I would sooner forfeit my life, my
pleasure, than my reputation.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> Egad, and so would I too.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcaps">Lady Darling's</span> <i>House</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Darling</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smallcaps">Angelica</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Lady D.</i> Daughter, since you have to deal with a
man of so peculiar a temper, you must not think the
general arts of love can secure him; you may therefore
allow such a courtier some encouragement extraordinary,
without reproach to your modesty.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> I am sensible, madam, that a formal nicety
makes our modesty sit awkward, and appears rather
a chain to enslave, than a bracelet to adorn us; it
should show, when unmolested, easy and innocent as
a dove, but strong and vigorous as a falcon, when assaulted.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> I'm afraid, daughter, you mistake Sir
Harry's gaiety for dishonour.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Though modesty, madam, may wink, it must
not sleep, when powerful enemies are abroad. I must
confess, that, of all men's, I would not see Sir Harry
Wildair's faults.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> You must certainly be mistaken, Angelica;
for I'm satisfied Sir Harry's designs are only
to court and marry you.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> His pretence, perhaps, was such. Pray, madam,
by what means were you made acquainted with
his designs?</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> Means, child! Why, my cousin Vizard,
who, I'm sure, is your sincere friend, sent him. He
brought me this letter from my cousin.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Gives her the Letter, which she opens.</i></p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Ha! Vizard!&mdash;then I'm abused in earnest&mdash;Would
Sir Harry, by his instigation, fix a base affront
upon me? No, I can't suspect him of so ungenteel a
crime&mdash;This letter shall trace the truth. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;My
suspicions, madam, are much cleared; and I
hope to satisfy your ladyship in my management,
when I next see Sir Harry.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Servant</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Serv.</i> Madam, here's a gentleman below, calls himself
Wildair.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> Conduct him up. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Servant</span>.] Daughter,
I won't doubt your discretion. </p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Darling</span>.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir Harry Wildair</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Oh, the delights of love and Burgundy!&mdash;Madam,
I have toasted your ladyship fifteen bumpers
successively, and swallowed Cupids like loches
to every glass.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> And what then, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why, then, madam, the wine has got into
my head, and the Cupids into my heart; and unless,
by quenching quick my flame, you kindly ease the
smart, I'm a lost man, madam.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Drunkenness, Sir Harry, is the worst pretence
a gentleman can make for rudeness; for the
excuse is as scandalous as the fault. Therefore, pray
consider who you are so free with, sir; a woman of
condition, that can call half a dozen footmen upon
occasion.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, madam, if you have a mind to toss
me in a blanket, half a dozen chambermaids would
do better service. Come, come, madam; though the
wine makes me lisp, yet it has taught me to speak
plainer. By all the dust of my ancient progenitors,
I must this night rest in your arms.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Nay, then&mdash;&mdash;who waits there?</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Footmen</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Take hold of that madman, and bind him.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, then, Burgundy's the word; slaughter
will ensue. Hold&mdash;Do you know, scoundrels, that I
have been drinking victorious Burgundy?&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Draws.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Servants.</i> We know you're drunk, sir.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Then how have you the impudence, rascals,
to assault a gentleman with a couple of flasks of courage
in his head?</p>

<p><i>Servants.</i> We must do as our young mistress commands
us.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Nay, then, have among ye, dogs! [<i>Throws
Money among them; they scramble and take it up: he
pelting them out, shuts the Door, and returns.</i>] Rascals,
poltroons!&mdash;I have charmed the dragon, and now the
fruit's my own. I have put the whole army to flight;
and now I'll take the general prisoner.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Laying hold on her.</i></p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> I conjure you, sir, by the sacred name of
Honour, by your dead father's name, and the fair reputation
of your mother's chastity, that you offer not
the least offence. Already you have wronged me past
redress.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Thou art the most unaccountable creature&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> What madness, Sir Harry, what wild dream
of loose desire, could prompt you to attempt this baseness?&mdash;View
me well&mdash;&mdash;the brightness of my mind,
methinks, should lighten outwards, and let you see
your mistake in my behaviour.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> [<i>Mimicking.</i>] Tal tidum, tidum, tal ti didi
didum. A million to one, now, but this girl is just
come flush from reading the Rival Queens&mdash;&mdash;'Egad,
I'll at her in her own cant&mdash;Oh, my Statira! Oh, my
angry dear! turn thy eyes on me&mdash;behold thy beau
in buskins.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Behold me, sir; view me with a sober thought,
free from those fumes of wine that throw a mist before
your sight, and you shall find that every glance
from my reproaching eyes is armed with sharp resentment,
and with a virtuous pride that looks dishonour
dead.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> This is the first whore in heroics that I have
met with. [<i>Aside.</i>] Lookye, madam, as to that slender
particular of your virtue, we sha'n't quarrel about it;
you may be as virtuous as any woman in England, if
you please. But, pray, madam, be pleased to consider,
what is this same virtue that you make such a
mighty noise about&mdash;Can your virtue keep you a
coach and six? No, no; your virtuous women walk
on foot.&mdash;Can your virtue stake for you at picquet?
No. Then what business has a woman with virtue?
Come, come, madam, I offered you fifty guineas;
there's a hundred&mdash;&mdash;The devil!&mdash;virtuous still!&mdash;Why,
it is a hundred, five score, a hundred guineas.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Oh, indignation! Were I a man, you durst
not use me thus. But the mean, poor abuse you
throw on me, reflects upon yourself: our sex still
strikes an awe upon the brave, and only cowards
dare affront a woman.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Affront! 'Sdeath, madam, a hundred guineas
will set you up a bank at basset; a hundred guineas
will furnish out your closet with china; a hundred
guineas will give you an air of quality; a hundred
guineas will buy you a rich cabinet for your
billet-doux, or a fine Common Prayer Book for your
virtue; a hundred guineas will buy a hundred fine
things, and fine things are for fine ladies, and fine
ladies are for fine gentlemen, and fine gentlemen are&mdash;&mdash;'Egad,
this Burgundy makes a man speak like
an angel&mdash;&mdash;Come, come, madam, take it, and put it
to what use you please.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> I'll use it as I would the base unworthy
giver, thus&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Throws down the Purse, and stamps upon it.</i></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I have no mind to meddle in state affairs;
but these women will make me a parliament-man in
spite of my teeth, on purpose to bring in a bill against
their extortion. She tramples under foot that deity
which all the world adores&mdash;Oh, the blooming pride
of beautiful eighteen!&mdash;Pshaw!&mdash;I'll talk to her no
longer; I'll make my market with the old gentlewoman;
she knows business better&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Goes to the
Door.</i>]&mdash;Here, you, friend: pray, desire the old lady
to walk in&mdash;&mdash;Harkye, 'egad, madam, I'll tell your
mother.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Darling</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> Well, Sir Harry, and how d'ye like my
daughter, pray?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Like her, madam!&mdash;Harkye, will you take
it?&mdash;Why, 'faith, madam&mdash;Take the money, I say,
or, 'egad, all's out.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> All shall out&mdash;Sir, you are a scandal to the
name of gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> With all my heart, madam&mdash;In short, madam,
your daughter has used me somewhat too familiarly,
though I have treated her like a woman of quality.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> How, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Why, madam, I have offered her a hundred
guineas.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> A hundred guineas! Upon what score?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Upon what score! Lord, lord, how these
old women love to hear bawdy!&mdash;Why, 'faith, madam,
I have never a <i>double entendre</i> ready at present;
but I suppose you know upon what score.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Hold, sir, stop your abusive tongue, too loose
for modest ears to hear&mdash;&mdash;Madam, I did before suspect,
that his designs were base, now they're too
plain; this knight, this mighty man of wit and humour,
is made a tool to a knave&mdash;Vizard has sent
him on a bully's errand, to affront a woman; but I
scorn the abuse, and him that offered it.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> How, sir, come to affront us! D'ye know
who we are, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Know who you are! Why, your daughter
there, is Mr. Vizard's&mdash;cousin, I suppose. And for
you, madam&mdash;I suppose your ladyship to be one of
those civil, obliging, discreet old gentlewomen, who
keep their visiting days for the entertainment of their
presenting friends, whom they treat with imperial
tea, a private room, and a pack of cards. Now I
suppose you do understand me.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> This is beyond sufferance! But say, thou
abusive man, what injury have you ever received from
me, or mine, thus to engage you in this scandalous
aspersion.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Yes, sir, what cause, what motives could induce
you thus to debase yourself below your rank?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Heyday! Now, dear Roxana, and you,
my fair Statira, be not so very heroic in your style:
Vizard's letter may resolve you, and answer all the
impertinent questions you have made me.</p>

<p><i>Lady D. and Ang.</i> We appeal to that.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> And I'll stand to't; he read it to me, and
the contents were pretty plain, I thought.</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Here, sir, peruse it, and see how much we
are injured, and you deceived.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> [<i>Opening the Letter.</i>] But hold, madam,
[<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Darling</span>.] before I read I'll make some
condition:&mdash;Mr. Vizard says here, that I won't scruple
thirty or forty pieces. Now, madam, if you have
clapped in another cypher to the account, and made
it three or four hundred, 'egad I'll not stand to't.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> The letter, sir, shall answer you.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Well then&mdash;[Reads.] <i>Out of my earnest inclination
to serve your ladyship, and my cousin Angelica</i>&mdash;Ay,
ay, the very words, I can say it by heart&mdash;<i>I
have sent Sir Harry Wildair to</i>&mdash;What the devil's
this?&mdash;<i>Sent Sir Harry Wildair to court my cousin</i>&mdash;He
read to me quite a different thing&mdash;<i>He's a gentleman
of great parts and fortune</i>&mdash;He's a son of a whore,
and a rascal&mdash;<i>And would make your daughter very
happy</i> [Whistles.] <i>in a husband</i>.&mdash;&mdash;[<i>Looks foolish, and
hums a Song.</i>]&mdash;Oh! poor Sir Harry, what have thy
angry stars designed?</p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Now, sir, I hope you need no instigation to
redress our wrongs, since even the injury points the
way.</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> Think, sir, that our blood for many generations
has run in the purest channel of unsullied honour.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Ay, madam.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Bows to her.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Consider what a tender flower is woman's reputation,
which the least air of foul detraction blasts.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Yes, madam.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Bows to the other.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> Call then to mind your rude and scandalous
behaviour.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Right, madam.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Bows again.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Ang.</i> Remember the base price you offered me.&nbsp;<span class="ind2">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Very true, madam. Was ever man so catechized?</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> And think that Vizard,&mdash;villain Vizard,&mdash;caused
all this, yet lives: that's all: farewell.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Stay, madam, [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Darling</span>.] one
word; is there no other way to redress your wrongs,
but by fighting?</p>

<p><i>Lady D.</i> Only one, sir; which, if you can think
of, you may do: you know the business I entertained
you for.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I understand you, madam. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady
Darling</span>.] Here am I brought to a very pretty dilemma.
I must commit murder, or commit matrimony;
which is the best now? a license from Doctors'
Commons, or a sentence from the Old Bailey?&mdash;If
I kill my man, the law hangs me; if I marry
my woman, I shall hang myself.&mdash;&mdash;But, damn it&mdash;cowards
dare fight:&mdash;I'll marry, that's the most daring
action of the two.&nbsp;<span class="ind2"><i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Here, fly all around, and bear these as directed;
you to Westminster, you to St. James's, and
you into the city. Tell all my friends, a bridegroom's
joy invites their presence. Tell them, I am married.
If any ask to whom, make no reply; but tell them,

<p class="noindent">A thousand welcomes, friend; my pleasure's now
complete, since I can share it with my friend: brisk
joy shall bound from me to you; then back again;
and, like the sun, grow warmer by reflection.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> You are always pleasant, Sir Harry; but
this transcends yourself: whence proceeds it?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Canst thou not guess, my friend? Whence
flows all earthly joy? What is the life of man, and
soul of pleasure? Woman.&mdash;&mdash;What fires the heart
with transport, and the soul with raptures?&mdash;Lovely
woman&mdash;&mdash;What is the master-stroke and smile of
the creation, but charming, virtuous woman?&mdash;Methinks,
my friend, you relish not my joy. What is
the cause?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Canst thou not guess?&mdash;What is the bane
of man, and scourge of life, but woman?&mdash;What is
the heathenish idol man sets up, and is damned for
worshipping? Treacherous woman.&mdash;Woman, whose
composition inverts humanity; their bodies heavenly,
but their souls are clay.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Come, come, colonel, this is too much: I
know your wrongs received from Lurewell may
excuse your resentment against her. But it is unpardonable
to charge the failings of a single woman
upon the whole sex. I have found one, whose virtues&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> So have I, Sir Harry; I have found
one whose pride's above yielding to a prince. And
if lying, dissembling, perjury, and falsehood, be no
breaches in a woman's honour, she is as innocent as
infancy.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Well, colonel, I find your opinion grows
stronger by opposition; I shall now, therefore, wave
the argument, and only beg you for this day to make
a show of complaisance at least.&mdash;Here comes my

sight; for if you are perfect woman, you have confidence
to outface a crime, and bear the charge of
guilt without a blush.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> The charge of guilt! what, making a
fool of you? I've done it, and glory in the act: dissembling
to the prejudice of men, is virtue; and every
look, or sign, or smile, or tear that can deceive, is
meritorious.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Very pretty principles, truly. If there
be truth in woman, 'tis now in thee. Come, madam,
you know that you're discovered, and, being sensible
that you cannot escape, you would now turn to bay.
That ring, madam, proclaims you guilty.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> O monster, villain, perfidious villain! Has
he told you?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I'll tell it you, and loudly too.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> O, name it not&mdash;&mdash;Yet, speak it out, 'tis
so just a punishment for putting faith in man, that I
will bear it all. Speak now, what his busy scandal,
and your improving malice, both dare utter.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Your falsehood can't be reached by malice
nor by satire; your actions are the justest libel on
your fame; your words, your looks, your tears, I did
believe in spite of common fame. Nay, 'gainst mine
own eyes, I still maintained your truth. I imagined
Wildair's boasting of your favours to be the pure result
of his own vanity: at last he urged your taking
presents of him; as a convincing proof of which, you
yesterday from him received that ring, which ring,
that I might be sure he gave it, I lent him for that
purpose.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Ha! you lent it him for that purpose!</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Yes, yes, madam, I lent it him for that
purpose&mdash;&mdash;No denying it&mdash;I know it well, for I
have worn it long, and desire it now, madam, to restore
it to the just owner.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> The just owner! Think, sir, think but of
what importance 'tis to own it: if you have love and
honour in your soul, 'tis then most justly yours; if
not, you are a robber, and have stolen it basely.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Ha! your words, like meeting flints,
have struck a light, to show me something strange
&mdash;&mdash;But tell me instantly, is not your real name
Manly?</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Answer me first: did not you receive this
ring about twelve years ago?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I did.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> And were not you about that time entertained
two nights at the house of Sir Oliver Manly,
in Oxfordshire?</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> I was! I was! [<i>Runs to her, and embraces
her.</i>] The blest remembrance fires my soul with
transport&mdash;&mdash;I know the rest&mdash;&mdash;you are the charming
she, and I the happy man.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> How has blind fortune stumbled on the
right? But where have you wandered since?&mdash;'Twas
cruel to forsake me.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> The particulars of my fortune are too
tedious now: but to discharge myself from the stain
of dishonour, I must tell you, that immediately upon
my return to the university, my elder brother and I
quarrelled: my father, to prevent farther mischief,
posts me away to travel: I wrote to you from London,
but fear the letter came not to your hands.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> I never had the least account of you by
letter, or otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Three years I lived abroad, and at my
return, found you were gone out of the kingdom,
though none could tell me whither: missing you thus,
I went to Flanders, served my king till the peace
commenced; then fortunately going on board at Amsterdam,
one ship transported us both to England.
At the first sight I loved, though ignorant of the hidden
cause&mdash;&mdash;You may remember, madam, that, talking
once of marriage, I told you I was engaged&mdash;to
your dear self I meant.</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> Then men are still most generous and
brave&mdash;and, to reward your truth, an estate of three
thousand pounds a year waits your acceptance; and,
if I can satisfy you in my past conduct, I shall expect
the honourable performance of your promise, and
that you will stay with me in England.</p>

<p><i>Colonel S.</i> Stay&mdash;Nor fame, nor glory e'er shall
part us more. My honour can be no where more
concerned than here.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Oh, Sir Harry! Fortune has acted miracles to-day:
the story's strange and tedious, but all amounts to
this&mdash;that woman's mind is charming as her person,
and I am made a convert too to beauty.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> I wanted only this, to make my pleasure
perfect.</p>

<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Smuggler</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Smug.</i> So, gentlemen and ladies, I'm glad to find
you so merry; is my gracious nephew among ye?</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Sir, he dares not show his face among such
honourable company; for your gracious nephew
is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> What, sir? Have a care what you say.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> A villain, sir.</p>

<p><i>Smug.</i> With all my heart. I'll pardon you the
beating me, for that very word. And pray, Sir Harry,
when you see him next, tell him this news from me,
that I have disinherited him&mdash;that I will leave him as
poor as a disbanded quarter-master.&mdash;Oh, Sir Harry,
he is as hypocritical&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady L.</i> As yourself, Mr. Alderman. How fares
my good old nurse, pray, sir?&mdash;&mdash;Come, Mr. Alderman,
for once let a woman advise:&mdash;Would you be
thought an honest man, banish covetousness, that
worst gout of age: avarice is a poor pilfering quality,
of the soul, and will, as certainly cheat, as a thief
would steal. Would you be thought a reformer of
the times, be less severe in your censures, less rigid in
your precepts, and more strict in your example.</p>

<p><i>Sir H.</i> Right, madam, virtue flows freer from imitation
than compulsion; of which, colonel, your conversion
and mine, are just examples.</p>
